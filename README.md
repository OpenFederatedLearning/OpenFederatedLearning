Privacy preserving technique allows sharing sensitive personal information while preserving users' privacy. Below are the technologies used in Federated Learning:

- Anonymization (weakest)
- Differential Privacy
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
- Zero Knowledge Proof (e.g. Blockchain)
- Confidential Computing through TEE (e.g. SGX and TrustZone)
